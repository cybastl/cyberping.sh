# This script pings a host for X times with a delay of Y seconds
#   If no packetloss ocurred it increases a counter by one
#   If packetloss occurs it prints the time and resets the counter
# Every Z counters it prints the current time
# Hostname, X, Y and Z are configurable via commalindline
# e.g. cyberping.sh google.com 5 0.2 50 (which is actually are the defaults)
